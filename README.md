Sorting Visualizer

A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built with React that helps you understand how different sorting algorithms work by animating their step-by-step process. This project is designed to make learning sorting algorithms more interactive and engaging.

✨ Features

🎨 Clean and responsive UI

⚡ Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms

⏱️ Adjustable speed controls (slow → fast)

🔢 Array size customization

▶️ Play, pause, and reset functionality

📊 Supports multiple algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS (or your CSS setup)

Animations: React hooks + DOM manipulation

🎯 Purpose

This project was built to:

Strengthen my understanding of sorting algorithms.

Practice React concepts like state management, props, conditional rendering, and event handling.

Demonstrate frontend development and problem-solving skills.


📌 Future Improvements

Add more algorithms (Heap Sort, Radix Sort).

Dark mode support.

Compare algorithms based on time complexity.
